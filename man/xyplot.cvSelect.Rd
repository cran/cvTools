\usage{
 \method{xyplot}{cvSelect} (x, data, subset = NULL, select
     = NULL, ...)

 \method{xyplot}{cvTuning} (x, data, subset = NULL, select
     = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{an object inheriting from class
  \code{"cvSelect"} that contains cross-validation results
  (note that this includes objects of class
  \code{"cvTuning"}).}

  \item{data}{currently ignored.}

  \item{subset}{a character, integer or logical vector
  indicating the subset of models for which to plot the
  cross-validation results.}

  \item{select}{a character, integer or logical vector
  indicating the columns of cross-validation results to be
  plotted.}

  \item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed to the
  \code{"formula"} method of
  \code{\link[lattice:xyplot]{xyplot}}.}
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{"trellis"} is returned
  invisibly.  The
  \code{\link[lattice:update.trellis]{update}} method can
  be used to update components of the object and the
  \code{\link[lattice:print.trellis]{print}} method
  (usually called by default) will plot it on an
  appropriate plotting device.
}
\description{
  Plot the (average) results from (repeated) \eqn{K}-fold
  cross-validation on the \eqn{y}-axis against the
  respective models on the \eqn{x}-axis.
}
\details{
  For objects with multiple columns of repeated
  cross-validation results, conditional plots are produced.

  In most situations, the default behavior is to represent
  the cross-validation results for each model by a vertical
  line segment (i.e., to call the default method of
  \code{\link[lattice:xyplot]{xyplot}} with \code{type =
  "h"}).  However, the behavior is different for objects of
  class \code{"cvTuning"} with only one numeric tuning
  parameter.  In that situation, the cross-validation
  results are plotted against the values of the tuning
  parameter as a connected line (i.e., by using \code{type
  = "b"}).

  The default behavior can of course be overridden by
  supplying the \code{type} argument (a full list of
  accepted values can be found in the help file of
  \code{\link[lattice:panel.xyplot]{panel.xyplot}}).
