     list(), envir = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
  \item{call}{an unevaluated function call for fitting a
  model (see \code{\link{call}}).}

  \item{data}{a data frame containing the variables
  required for fitting the models.  This is typically used
  if the model in the function call is described by a
  \code{\link[stats]{formula}}.}

  \item{x}{a numeric matrix containing the predictor
  variables.  This is typically used if the function call
  for fitting the models requires the predictor matrix and
  the response to be supplied as separate arguments.}

  \item{y}{a numeric vector or matrix containing the
  response.}

  \item{cost}{a cost function measuring prediction loss.
  It should expect the observed values of the response to
  be passed as the first argument and the predicted values
  as the second argument, and must return a non-negative
  scalar value.  The default is to use the root mean
  squared prediction error (see \code{\link{cost}}).}

  \item{folds}{an object of class \code{"cvFolds"} giving
  the folds of the data for cross-validation (as returned
  by \code{\link{cvFolds}}).}

  \item{names}{an optional character vector giving names
  for the arguments containing the data to be used in the
  function call (see \dQuote{Details}).}

  \item{predictArgs}{a list of additional arguments to be
  passed to the \code{\link[stats]{predict}} method of the
  fitted models.}

  \item{costArgs}{a list of additional arguments to be
  passed to the prediction loss function \code{cost}.}

  \item{envir}{the \code{\link{environment}} in which to
  evaluate the function call for fitting the models (see
  \code{\link{eval}}).}
}
\value{
  A numeric matrix in which each column contains the
  respective estimated prediction errors from all
  replications.

\description{
  Basic function to estimate the prediction error of a
  model via (repeated) \eqn{K}-fold cross-validation.  The
  model is thereby specified by an unevaluated function
  call to a model fitting function.
}
\details{
  (Repeated) \eqn{K}-fold cross-validation is performed in
  the following way.  The data are first split into \eqn{K}
  previously obtained blocks of approximately equal size
  (given by \code{folds}).  Each of the \eqn{K} data blocks
  is left out once to fit the model, and predictions are
  computed for the observations in the left-out block with
  the \code{\link[stats]{predict}} method of the fitted
  model.  Thus a prediction is obtained for each
  observation.

  The response variable and the obtained predictions for
  all observations are then passed to the prediction loss
  function \code{cost} to estimate the prediction error.
  For repeated cross-validation (as indicated by
  \code{folds}), this process is replicated and the
  estimated prediction errors from all replications are
  returned.

  Furthermore, if the response is a vector but the
  \code{\link[stats]{predict}} method of the fitted models
  returns a matrix, the prediction error is computed for
  each column.  A typical use case for this behavior would
  be if the \code{\link[stats]{predict}} method returns
  predictions from an initial model fit and stepwise
  improvements thereof.

  If \code{data} is supplied, all variables required for
  fitting the models are added as one argument to the
  function call, which is the typical behavior of model
  fitting functions with a \code{\link[stats]{formula}}
  interface.  In this case, a character string specifying
  the argument name can be passed via \code{names} (the
  default is to use \code{"data"}).

  If \code{x} is supplied, on the other hand, the predictor
  matrix and the response are added as separate arguments
  to the function call.  In this case, \code{names} should
  be a character vector of length two, with the first
  element specifying the argument name for the predictor
  matrix and the second element specifying the argument
  name for the response (the default is to use \code{c("x",
  "y")}).  It should be noted that \code{data} takes
  precedence over \code{x} if both are supplied.
